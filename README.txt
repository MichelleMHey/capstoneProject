Project is not complete yet...

This application has the following funcitonality tested:

Phase One (completed):

-Uses Bootstrap
-Using JSON and AJAX, username, post tags, and post comments, are "POST" to server onclick, and sent back to webpage to be displayed with "GET".

Phase Two (completed):

-Added a comment box from www.htmlcommentbox.com
	-This comment box is used to show what I want to create in the future.
	-The htmlcommentbox allows me to monitor users posts and remove posts.
-I'm still using my personally created comment box, which I used JSON and AJAX to store user data. 
-I added an autocomplete search bar where users can search the school of their choice and be redirected to that schools home page. 
-I added a user sign up form.

Phase Three (completed):

-Got my demo comment box to display user posts from newest to oldest.
-Demo comment box refreshes and does not loose the previously submitted comments. 
-Added form validation to the sign up form.
-Used ajax to POST the user input from the submitted form.
-Added more CSS.
-Created an alphabetical school list, that first displays all the schools, but when a letter is picked, schools starting with that specific letter will only be displayed. 

Phase Four (will be completed by Wednesday):

-Clean up CSS to make the website look attractive.
